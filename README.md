## 🚀 Featured Project  
### **Excelerate Data Visualization Internship Project**
📅 *First project added to this portfolio — more projects coming soon!*  

**Overview**  
This project demonstrates my ability to convert multi-source raw data into insightful and interactive dashboards.  
Built during my ongoing **Excelerate Data Analyst Internship**, it focuses on creating a **Master Table architecture**, executing **ETL pipelines**, and performing **advanced analytics** to identify performance metrics and engagement trends.  

I implemented strong analytical techniques — including **data profiling, KPI forecasting, and anomaly detection** — while leveraging **SQL joins, window functions, and transformation logic** in PostgreSQL.  
The Looker Studio dashboards built from this process visualize learner performance, opportunity tracking, and engagement metrics with clarity and precision.  

**Key Contributions**
- Architected a **PostgreSQL-based Master Table** combining learner, opportunity, and progress datasets.  
- Applied advanced **data transformation, validation, and business logic** for quality and consistency.  
- Designed **Looker Studio dashboards** showcasing KPIs, performance metrics, and growth insights.  
- Conducted **trend analysis and data-driven storytelling** using advanced visual layers and filters.  
- Created **ETL documentation** to ensure replicability, scalability, and long-term maintainability.  

**Tools Used**  
PostgreSQL · SQL · Python (Pandas, NumPy) · Looker Studio · Excel · Data Quality Framework
